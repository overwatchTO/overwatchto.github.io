      <p>The Toronto Overwatch Beer League (TOBL) is an organized league where players can play a full regular season schedule with a consistent team. Hosted at <a href="http://raidersesports.com/">Raiders eSports Centre</a>, the league provides a more social experience than queuing up at home.</p>
      <p>At TOBL players will be able to get familiar with playing in an organized team environment, build strategies based on playing against the same teams, and meet other Overwatch players in person in a fun social environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Season 1 is underway now!</strong></p>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>What is the Toronto Overwatch Beer League?</h2>
      <p>The Toronto Overwatch Beer League is a recreational eSports league intended to give players of all different skill levels around Toronto the opportunity to play Overwatch in a competitive eSports environment while also providing a fun, social atmosphere.</p>
      <h2>Where do matches take place?</h2>
      <p>All matches for the Toronto Overwatch Beer League are hosted at Raiders eSports Centre. Once the season begins, matches will take place on Sunday nights.</p>
      <h2>Can I play from home?</h2>
      <p>No. The league is built as a LAN organization. All teams come and compete at Raiders and play beside one another, which ensures a more unified team and keeps the league social and interactive.</p>
      <h2>Can I use my own peripherals (e.g. mouse, keyboard)?</h2>
      <p>Yes, Raiders allows players to bring their own peripherals to use on their machines.</p>
      <h2>How many teams are in the league?</h2>
      <p>At this time, we are limiting the league to 8 teams in total for Season 1. In future seasons the league may expand, depending on demand.</p>
      <h2>How many players on a team?</h2>
      <p>Teams have a minimum of six players, and a maximum of twelve players.</p>
      <h2>I don't have a team. Can I still play?</h2>
      <p>Yes! Before Season 1 begins, we'll be opening individual registration. We'll then have a "Player Draft" night where all players who signed up as individuals will be eligible to be drafted. Players and teams can come to Raiders and meet each other, the teams can get a sense of the players that are available in the draft, and a live draft will take place later in the evening. More details about the Draft will be posted soon.</p>
      <h2>I'm not a very high rank. Can I still play?</h2>
      <p>Yes. There is no minimum entry rank to be eligible to play in the league. The intention of the league is for players to have fun and enjoy Overwatch as a team game, as well as socialize.</p>
      <h2>How much will it cost to play?</h2>
      <p>The final cost per person is still being determined, but our aim is to keep the cost of playing as low as possible. The Overwatch Toronto Organization (the organizers of the Toronto Overwatch Beer League) and everyone else working on this are not doing it for profit. We are estimating that, per team, the registration cost should be somewhere between $250-350, or $25 to $35 per person for a team with a full 10 player roster.</p>
      <h2>What is the registration fee for?</h2>
      <p>The registration fee is almost entirely to cover the cost of the facilities at Raiders eSports Centre. Beyond that, there are also some small ancillary costs to cover, such as web hosting, etc.</p>
      <h2>Do I need to own a copy of Overwatch to play in the league?</h2>
      <p>Yes. All Players in the league must own a copy of Overwatch (PC) to be eligible to play. They must also have a Battle.net account in good standing.</p>
      <h2>Can I volunteer to help?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely! We welcome any volunteers who would like to help with a variety of league related responsibilities. If you're interested in volunteering, feel free to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>
