      <h2>Sign up as an individual</h2>
      <p>Don't have a team? No problem! You can sign up as an individual and get drafted to a team on our Draft Night before the season begins.</p>
      <p>Individual players don't pay registration costs unless they're drafted by a team, at which point their cost is a share of the team's registration fee.</p>
	    <p>All players will be required to pay a <strong>$10 registration deposit</strong> to be eligible to participate in the player draft. Player deposits are refundable in the event a draft does not take place, or if the player is not drafted to a team. Payment can be made either via Paypal to <a href="mailto:overwatchtorontoorg@gmail.com">overwatchtorontoorg@gmail.com</a>, or in person at the Preseason Showcase event and Draft Night.</p>
