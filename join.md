      <p>If you have at least three players, you can register a team. The rest of your roster will be filled out on Draft Night from the pool of individual signups. The maximum team size is 4 players.</p>
      <p>Team registration costs <strong>$225</strong> per team. Team payment is due before the first day of matches.</p>
      <p>Teams will play 7 regular season matches in Season 5, plus a series of playoff days where any team can fight to take top prize.</p>

      <h2>Sign up as an individual</h2>
      <p>You can sign up as an individual and get drafted to a team on our Draft Night before the season begins.</p>
      <p>Individual players don't pay registration costs unless they're drafted by a team, at which point their cost is a share of the team's registration fee.</p>
      <p>However, all players will be required to pay a <strong>$10 registration deposit</strong> to be eligible to participate in the player draft. After the player is drafted, the $10 goes towards that team's registration fee. Player deposits are refundable in the event that the player is not drafted to a team. Payment can be made either via Paypal to <a href="mailto:overwatchtoronto.org@gmail.com">overwatchtoronto.org@gmail.com</a>, or in person at the Preseason Showcase event and Draft Night.</p>
	    <p><strong>Registration for Season 5 is now closed.</strong></p>
